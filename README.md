# Video Gambling Data Analysis

This was a project done for the class IS470 Business Intelligence and Big Data. In this project, data analysis on video gambling and its effects on the city of Decatur, IL was done. Data visualizations were also created after completing analysis. This project was completed using R. Please note - this was a team project so only my code is seen here. Other visualizations and analysis were done by my partner and included in the final report.
