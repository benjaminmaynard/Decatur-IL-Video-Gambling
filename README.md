Video Gambling Data Analysis

Data analysis and data visualization project on video gambling and its effects on the city of Decatur, IL. For this project, I had meetings a Decatur city councilman and the GIS coordinator for the City of the Decatur to gather insight on what the City might like to know about video gambling in Decatur. After these initial meetings, data on video gambling (from 2012 to 2019) was obtained from the Illinois Gaming Board's website. Socioeconomic and census data was also obtained from the United States Census Bureau. 
R was used to clean and transform the data as well as to combine the video gambling data sets with socioeconomic data. Multiple visualizations were included with the most complex being heat maps of spatial data. In order to create these GIS heat maps, multiple data sets of spatial data were combined. These maps showed amount of money spent gambling at an establishment vs income in that establishment's area (census tract) using R. Our final result was that video gambling is not helping the City of Decatur. Additionally, this projedct is continuing on this semester with the goal of presenting even more in depth findings to the Decatur city council.
